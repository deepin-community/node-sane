Description: Nodejs fast, small, and reliable file system watcher
 Sane aims to be fast, small, and reliable file system watcher. It does
 that by:
  * By default stays away from fs polling because it's very slow and cpu
   intensive
  * Uses `fs.watch` by default and sensibly works around the various issues
  * Maintains a consistent API across different platforms
  * Where `fs.watch` is not reliable you have the choice of using the following
   alternatives:
   * the facebook watchman library (embedded)
   * the watchexec library (embedded)
   * polling
